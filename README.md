## Why the project is userful?

I have created this blog using Flask, HTML, CSS, Python, and some basic javascript from bootstrap.
It is build with simple and sorted program.

+ If you go through the repository, you can see html + python(using jinja) codes inside a [template file](https://github.com/ArshdeepKaurArora/arsh_blog/tree/main/templates).
+ Styling of the blog is done with CSS and javascript inside [static file](https://github.com/ArshdeepKaurArora/arsh_blog/tree/main/static).
+ Finally, the [main file](https://github.com/ArshdeepKaurArora/arsh_blog/blob/main/main.py) is creating the app and user render platform, this application is on a remote server.

## How to use the codes of this project?

Perform the following steps to work with the code properly.

+ Use the command `pip instal -r requirements.txt` on the terminal to install all the required packages.
+ Use the latest version of python (I have used python 3.11.1).
+ Run `db.create_all()` command on main.py to create fresh tables.
+ Replace the environment variables with own known values corresponding to the variable name.
+ Run main.py.

There you go. You have got your own blog (Don't forget to change mine name and profile with yours in header and about page.) at local server.
